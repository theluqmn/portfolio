# Portfolio

Repository for my portfolio website, which is hosted at [theluqmn.github.io](https://theluqmn.github.io). The actual repository is a fork of this repository, but only has the `gh-pages` branch.

Unlike the previous version, this website is single-page without any routing involved. My goal is to make a website that looks familiar, but has its own identity and feel attached to it. Still looks like the archetype of most modern websites, but with my own style. Controlled craziness.

## Development

This website will undergo a lot of changes in the future, as I no longer plan on rewriting it from scratch anymore since its a lot of work lol. Some of the features I want to add:

- [ ] Navigation menu (currently the button has no functionality)
- [ ] More customised components and frames
- [ ] A proper footer
- [ ] Some more cool pictures

## Stack

- Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
- Framework: Solidjs
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
