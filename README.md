# Portfolio

Repository for my portfolio website, which is hosted at [theluqmn.github.io](https://theluqmn.github.io). The actual repository is a fork of this repository, but only has the `gh-pages` branch.

Unlike the previous version, this website is single-page without any routing involved. It has a larger emphasis on actually having viewers to visit my projects, and less on the actual website itself.
